            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p id="para"> I introduced coding to the children by walking through printed Scratch worksheets. Most of them are self explanatory however, there were inevitebly questions but I was always there happy to help. In order to cater to the more advanced students who usually already had prior pre-existing knowledge; I used a whiteboard as a visual aid and demonstrated how the fundamental programming concepts embedded within Scratch translates into Python. I chose Python as it is a relatively easy programming language, and some of the more advanced students already had previous experience with it. This approach allowed me to challenge advanced students but also reinforce my own knowledge as teaching others is a good way to refresh and ensure that I understand the basics myself. I also created a friendly programming competition for all the students but it was tailored to test their own personal skills, so the more advanced students had harder questions and so on.</p>
