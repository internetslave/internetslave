## Workflow
Despite the fact that I quickly hacked this together, and was only working on it myself I tried to simulate an actual professional environment to the best of my abilities / within reason. 

* FIGMA: tried to make figma design (ss of figma)
It's obviously not complete, as designs change continously, and plans change but it's more of a rough draft.

*JIRA:to keep track of tasks to do (ss of jira)

*Used git: Made branch for each new feature – merged it into main (always had currently working version) as main. 


## Justification
* Stayed away from conventional website layout / content (about me, hobbies)  
* I used custom CSS and zero frameworks. I kept it as basic as possible as I found most people struggle writing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The usually implement additional libraries to make it look aesthetically pleasing but I wanted to not rely on crutches like bootstrap etc. I wanted to ensure I had the fundamentals down before moving onto something more complex


## Future Improvements
* Blog style: I’ve done a lot of writing, and I enjoy it hence me being a library student mentor for academic writing – so I think transforming this into a blog where I can post more long form content is more appropriate. Instead of just stuffing a bunch of text in flexboxes.  
* Use react framework (SPA) overall – but could’ve helped with this current feature (toggle btn / header column and appropriate text changing based on button click) 
* Create my coding journey (timeline) interactive – links to every GitHub project and reflections etc. – cool interactive feature.  
* My git commits are atrocious and all over the place – a lot of room for improvement there.
