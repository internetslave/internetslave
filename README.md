## Workflow
Despite the fact that I quickly hacked this together, and was only working on it myself I tried to simulate an actual professional environment to the best of my abilities.

* [Figma](https://github.com/internetslave/personal-website/assets/80433265/69e7ee58-6455-48ce-b67f-1dec226cf428)
: Used it to design an initial rough draft, however the design has changed (ex:the navigation buttons are now on the left). However, I only decided to make these changes once I was well into the coding process and left the design phase so it was useless to readjust it in Figma after the fact.

* [Jira](https://github.com/internetslave/personal-website/assets/80433265/37d23dcf-3510-4727-8f94-bddea6d54f5c) : used it to keep track of tasks
* Git: Made branch for each new feature – merged it into main (always had currently working version) as main. 



## Justification
* Stayed away from conventional portfolio website layout & content(about me, hobbies, contact me). I find that said approach, feels completely impersonal to me. 
* I used custom CSS and zero frameworks. I kept it as basic as possible as I found most people struggle writing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. They usually implement additional libraries to make it look aesthetically pleasing but I wanted to not rely on crutches like Bootstrap. I wanted to ensure I had the fundamentals down before moving onto something more complex. 


## Future Improvements
* Create a dedicated Blog section: I’ve done a lot of writing, and plan to do more in the future. Transforming a part of the website into a blog is better than just stuffing a bunch of text in flexboxes.
* Use React: The current home page's toggle button causes different navigation buttons to populate the flexbox columns depending on the header clicked (it dynamically changes the content without refreshing the page). I wrote it using vanilla Javascript which made it extremely complicated. In the future, I should use React as it was initially created to solve the challenges associated with SPAs(Single Page Applications). 
* Create an interactive timeline that displays my coding journey so far: links to every previous coding project and provides reflections on it
